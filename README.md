# Kalman-SNN-nengo
Kalman-SNN Filter with Nengo

Self-implement code for paper: "Design and validation of a real-time spiking-neural-network decoder for brainâ€“machine interfaces" and "A Brain-Machine Interface Operating with a Real-Time piking Neural Network Control Algorithm"

I use one 2-D recurrent neuron pools insteal of a 3-D recurrent neuron pools or two 1-D recurrent neuron pools, which are used in the paper

`kalman-snn-update.py` stands for the version which has the dynamic change of Kalman Gain during iteration.
